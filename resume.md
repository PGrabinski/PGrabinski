# Summary
 Oscillating my whole life between computers and physics, I have tackled things from theoretical physics to application development. Optimizing my career-choice function across the parameter space of the abstract concepts, visible results, programming, and scientific method, I arrived at the Machine Learning point. I am mostly interested in the Reinforcement Learnig, but I am open for any methods for AI development.

# Skills

* **Python:** Numpy, Tensorflow 2.0 &amp; Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas, XGBoost, Scikit Learn
* **Web:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, JavaScript,
* **Others:** C/C++, SQL, Mathematica, Matlab&amp;Octave
* **Tools:** Git, Latex, Linux, Jupyter Notebooks
* **Languages:** Polish (native), English (IELTS 7.5 - C1)

# Experience
## Master Thesis
### Project: [Numerical Solution for Differential Equations with Neural Networks](https://github.com/PGrabinski/NeuralDifferentialEquations)
#### Time and place: University of Wrocław, 02.2019-03.2020
**Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Tensorflow 2.0

 In the course of the one year long work on this subject:
* I have reproduced the results of the work Lagaris, et al. concerning the Trial Solution scheme - a numerical method for solving differential equations using neural networks optimized without additional constraints as the initial or boundary conditons are incorporated directly into the solution.
* I have reproduced the results of the work Shirvany, et al. concerning solving the Schroedinger equation using neural networks optimized with constraints being functions of the initial or boundary conditons.
* I have conducted some additional experiments mixing the above methods.

The code for the first method was written both from scratch in Numpy and using the Tensorflow 2.x framework. The second method was researched solely using Tensorflow 2.x.


## Machine Learning Summer Intern
### Project: Non-GPS Indoor Localization System
#### Time and place: [NeuroSYS](https://neurosys.com), 07-08.2018
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit Learn, Keras, NumPy&amp;SciPy, FilterPy

Working within the agile (Scrum) methodology, I performed the following tasks:
* Reasearched publications and existing solutions,
* Scripted data transformation for WiFi RSS data,
* Worked on a model for RSS-to-position prediction,
* Implemented the Particle Filter (Monte Carlo model),
* Implemented server-side logic,
* Worked on vision-localization model.

## Summer Student Programme
### Project: [Machine Learning in High Energy Physics](https://github.com/PGrabinski/ATLAS_ML)
**Technologies:** C++ (ROOT, TMVA), Python (XGBoost, Hyperopt)

 Hands-on introduction to machine learning using particle detector data.
