Oscillating my whole life between computers and physics, I have tackled things from theoretical physics to application development. 
Optimizing my career-choice function across the parameter space of the abstract concepts, visible results, programming, and scientific method, I arrived at the Machine Learning point. Now, I am building my career upon it. I am mostly interested in the Reinforcement Learning, but I am open to other ways of building AI as well.
