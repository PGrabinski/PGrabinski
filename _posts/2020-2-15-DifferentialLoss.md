title: Differentiating in Tensorflow 2.0
---

This will be a post about differentiating in Tensorflow 2.0 with an example of a loss function consisting of a differential of the neural network.

In the begining, I was working with neural networks either writing them from scrath in NumPy or with Keras framework. At some point during my experiments concerning the subject of my master thesis, I wanted to compare the results acquired with my from-scratch implementation with one written in a matured framework. My first choice was obviously Keras. Unfortunately, despite finding some interesting answers on the Stackoverflow, I could not achieve with it one, relatively simple, thing - I could not define a loss function build with derivative of the network. Here, in this post, I am going to show you how to use new Tensorflow 2.x object called Tape and how can it be used to differentiate anything and anywhere, e.g. network response in the loss function.

## Tensorflow 2.0 - new way to go

Let's start with the problem of defining a simple model in Tensorflow 2.x what can be found in [the official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner). It relys mostly on the Keras as high level abstraction layer for model definition in Tensorflow. We are going to fit our network to approximate a logarithm function as in [the acompanying Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17P6XDmYbNULQOgnEjxJJDwOYfaNbxopK)

We begin with standard imports and definition of our samples **X** and targets **Y**.

{% highlight python %}
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

X = np.arange(0.1,2,0.1)
Y = np.log(X)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we define our model using the Sequential class that represents a simple feedforward network. We use three Dense layers. The first two are composed of 20 units and end with sigmoid activation function. The third one has a single linear output. We should specify the input shape. It is not necessary, but automatically calls **build()** method and allows us to summarize our model.
{% highlight python %}
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(20, input_shape=(1,),
                            activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(20, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.summary()
{% endhighlight %}
We receive the following description of the model.
![Summary of the model]({{ site.baseurl }/images/diffinTF2/summary.jpg "Summary"})

With the method **compile()**, we specify the optimizer (in this case stochastic gradient descent), a loss function (mean square error), and a list of metrics (mean absolute arror).
{% highlight python %}
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1), loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can train the network.
{% highlight python %}
history = model.fit(x=X, y=Y, epochs=10000, verbose=0)
{% endhighlight %}
