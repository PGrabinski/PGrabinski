title: Differentiating in Tensorflow 2.0
---

This will be a post about differentiating in Tensorflow 2.0 with an example of a loss function consisting of a differential of the neural network.

In the begining, I was working neural networks either writing them from scrath in NumPy or with Keras framework. The
