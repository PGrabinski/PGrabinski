Before setting up this blog, I have written several posts for the startup [mljar](https://mljar.com/) considering the basics of machine learning.

Some of them you can find here:
1. [Validation - Learning, Not Memorizing](https://mljar.com/blog/validation-learning-not-memorizing/),
2. [Feature engineering - tell your model what to look at](https://mljar.com/blog/feature-engineering-tell-your-model-what-to-look-at/) which can be found also at [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/12/feature-engineering-explained.html).

I believe that these are solid introductions to the topics for people who begin their journey with ML.
